# RNA-seq-Analysis
This repository is about using tools to analyze RNA-seq data by mapping the reads to a reference genome,followed by transcriptom assembly.
In this project, we will use two piplines. 
  1-  HISAT2 as an aligner, and StringTie as an assembler.
  2-  STAR as an aligner, and Scripture as an assembler. 
pipline1 file is illustrating all the requirments and steps to apply HISAT/StringTie pipline, while pipeline2 file is allocated for STAR/Scripture pipeline.
