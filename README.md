# RNA-seq-Analysis
 This project is about using tools to analyze RNA-seq data by mapping the reads to a reference genome,followed by transcriptom assembly.
- In this project, we will use two pipelines. 
 1- HISAT2 as an aligner, and StringTie as an assembler.
 2-  STAR as an aligner, and Scripture as an assembler. 
- pipline1.sh file is illustrating all the requirements and steps to apply HISAT/StringTie pipeline
