#implementing HISAT2 and Stringtie 

- Requierments: 
  1-  a unix operating system (in this project, ubuntu 16.04 was used) 
  2-  64-bit computer with 4 to 8 GB RAM 
  3-  HISAT2 software
  4-  Samtools 
  5-  StringTie software
  6-  The data to use (in this case, chromosome X data - Homosapiens) 

- downloads and installment:  
  1-  download the data using the following command on the terminal (The zip file is around 2GB)
$ wget ftp://ftp.ccb.jhu.edu/pub/RNAseq_protocol/chrX_data.tar.gz
      when the file is downloaded, got to the downloads directory and unzip the file by using the following commands
$ cd /home/$username/Downloads
#where username is your OS user name
$ tar xvzf chrX_data.tar.gz
$ cd

  2-  if you don't hav GitHub installed already in your OS, use the following command on the terminal to install it. 
$ sudo apt-get install git
  
  3-  clone HISAT2 from GitHub using the following command 
$ git clone https://github.com/infphilo/hisat2

  4-  download Samtools into your device -version later that 1.2 is requiered to analyse data more easily. 
The latest version at the time of writting this script is 1.6. The following command will download Samtools1.6. 
$ git clone git://github.com/samtools/samtools/releases/tag/1.6
      when the file is downloaded, got to the downloads directory, unzip the file, get inside the directory 
      and make release it by using the following commands
$ cd /home/$username/Downloads
#where username is your OS user name 
$ tar jxvf samtools-1.6.tar.bz2
$ cd samtools-1.6
$ make
$ cd

#if you used the command 
$ sudo apt-get install samtools
it'll install samtools-0.1.19, which will cost you more steps when applying the analysis. 
  
  5-  clone StringTie from GitHub using the following command
$ git clone https://github.com/gpertea/stringtie
      when the software is installed, get inside the directory and make release it by using the following two commands
$ cd stringtie
$ make release
$ cd

- Setting the environment: 
  1-  create a directory to store all the requiered inputs/outputs inside. The file created could be named RNA-seq, use the 
      following command
$ mkdir $HOME/RNA-seq
      where $HOME is the desired path to place the directory at.
